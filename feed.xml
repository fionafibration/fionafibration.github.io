But what really is good imaging? How can you tell what has good imaging and soundstage without having tried them before, from objective measurements? To understand this, we first have to understand how your ears ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>The Eilenberg-Steenrod Axioms and Generalized (Co)homology Theories</title><link href="https://fiona1729.com/posts/generalised-homology/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Eilenberg-Steenrod Axioms and Generalized (Co)homology Theories" /><published>2022-08-27T04:44:00+01:00</published> <updated>2024-02-02T22:10:14+00:00</updated> <id>https://fiona1729.com/posts/generalised-homology/</id> <content src="https://fiona1729.com/posts/generalised-homology/" /> <author> <name>Fiona Blackett</name> </author> <category term="Talks &amp; Slides" /> <summary> A talk I gave as part of an online seminar on stable homotopy theory: </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Site infrastructure</title><link href="https://fiona1729.com/posts/site-infrastructure/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Site infrastructure" /><published>2022-01-12T19:34:00+00:00</published> <updated>2024-02-02T22:10:14+00:00</updated> <id>https://fiona1729.com/posts/site-infrastructure/</id> <content src="https://fiona1729.com/posts/site-infrastructure/" /> <author> <name>Fiona Blackett</name> </author> <category term="Miscellaneous" /> <summary> Hello all, for my first post here I figured I’d write a bit about my hosting of this site.
